# Walmart Sales Analysis
Walmart sales data analysis with MySQL. This involved data cleaning, Feature Engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using MySQL
## Purpose of the Project
The primary objective of this project is to analyze Walmart's sales data in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the various factors that impact the sales performance across its different store branches.
## About Data
The dataset was sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition and comprises sales transactions from three distinct Walmart branches situated in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. This dataset is composed of 17 columns and 1000 rows.

## Different Approaches
1. Data Cleaning: In this initial step, the data is inspected to identify and address any NULL or missing values. Data replacement techniques are then applied to fill in or replace these missing or NULL values.
   1. Build a database
   2. Create table and insert the data.
   3. Select columns with null values in them. There are no null values in our database as in creating the tables, we set NOT NULL for each field, hence null values are filtered out
2. Feature Engineering: This will help generate new columns from existing ones.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
